        hi! i'm thomas and this is my <del>boring</del> professional website. i'm a software engineer in nyc and a <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">recurse center</a> alumnus. i currently work at <a href="https://classpass.com">classpass</a> as a senior front-end engineer.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>i make things and put them on the internet at <a class="important-link" href="https://disco.zone/">disco.zone</a></strong>, a tld that i am very proud to have purchased before anyone else did. my favorite project so far is <a class="important-link" href="https://manygolf.club/">manygolf</a>, a massively-multiplayer golf game you can play in your browser, which was featured in publications like <a href="https://boingboing.net/2016/08/26/manygolf-simple-addictive-on.html">boing boing</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        more recently, i've been working on <a href="https://jambuds.club" class="important-link">jam buds</a>, a site for sharing music with your friends.
      </p>

      <p>
        source code for those and other projects in various states of success and failure can be found on <a class="important-link" href="https://github.com/thomasboyt">my github profile</a>. i've also got a very-infrequently-updated <a class="important-link" href="https://devlog.disco.zone/">dev blog</a>.
      </p>
