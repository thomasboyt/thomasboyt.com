        <strong>i make things and put them on the internet at <a class="important-link" href="http://disco.zone/">disco.zone</a></strong>, a tld that i am very proud to have purchased before anyone else did. my favorite project so far is <a class="important-link" href="https://manygolf.club/">manygolf</a>, a massively-multiplayer golf game you can play in your browser, which was featured in publications like <a href="https://boingboing.net/2016/08/26/manygolf-simple-addictive-on.html">boing boing</a>. more recently, i've been working on <a class="important-link" href="https://disco.zone/pearl/">pearl</a>, a simple typescript games framework, as well as <a class="important-link" href="https://github.com/thomasboyt/jam-buds">jam buds</a>, a lil site for sharing music with friends written with typescript &amp; vue.
