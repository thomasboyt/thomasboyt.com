      <h1><span class="name">thomas boyt's</span> extremely boring website</h1>

      <p>
        hi! i'm thomas and this is my <del>boring</del> professional website. i'm a software engineer in new york city and <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">recurse center</a> alumnus.
      </p>

      <p>
        i'm currently looking for a new full-time job. if you're on the hunt for a javascript developer, you should take a peek at my <a href="/resume.html">resume</a>! i'm based in nyc, and primarily looking for remote-friendly gigs at the moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>i make video games and put them on the internet at <a class="me-link" href="http://disco.zone/">disco.zone</a></strong>, a tld that i am very proud to have purchased before anyone else did. currently i'm working on <a class="me-link" href="https://manygolf.club/">manygolf</a>, a massively-multiplayer golf game you can play in your browser.
      </p>

      <p>
        various other projects in various states of success and failure can be found on <a class="me-link" href="https://github.com/thomasboyt">my github profile</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        i'm on twitter at <a class="me-link" href="https://twitter.com/thomasaboyt">@thomasABoyt</a>. some dude from indiana grabbed the much better @thomasboyt handle, but i got the last laugh with this domain name, assuming that the current DNS domain system outlasts twitter. maybe some day i'll befriend someone who works at twitter and figure out how to get @tboyt away from whoever isn't using it.
      </p>

      <p>
        if you'd like to email me, you can do so at <a class="me-link" href="mailto:me@thomasboyt.com">me@thomasboyt.com</a>. but if you actually want to get in contact with me quickly, twitter is probably the better option. as is, like, smoke signal, or carrier pigeon.
