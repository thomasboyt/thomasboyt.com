      <p>
      hi! i'm thomas and this is my <del>boring</del> professional website. i'm a software engineer in new york city and <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">recurse center</a> alumnus.
      </p>

      <p>
        i'm currently working at <a href="https://www.harrys.com/">harry's</a>, a company that makes and sells razors. i'm not a razor expert but they're quite good, imo. but for real don't ask me for shaving tips because i still cut my face shaving an embarrassing number of times a month.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>i make video games and put them on the internet at <a class="me-link" href="http://disco.zone/">disco.zone</a></strong>, a tld that i am very proud to have purchased before anyone else did. currently i'm working on <a class="me-link" href="https://manygolf.club/">manygolf</a>, a massively-multiplayer golf game you can play in your browser.
      </p>

      <p>
        various other projects in various states of success and failure can be found on <a class="me-link" href="https://github.com/thomasboyt">my github profile</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        i'm on twitter at <a class="me-link" href="https://twitter.com/thomasaboyt">@thomasABoyt</a>. some dude from indiana grabbed the much better @thomasboyt handle, but i got the last laugh with this domain name, assuming that the current DNS domain system outlasts twitter. maybe some day i'll befriend someone who works at twitter and figure out how to get @tboyt away from whoever isn't using it.
      </p>

      <p>
        if you'd like to email me, you can do so at <a class="me-link" href="mailto:me@thomasboyt.com">me@thomasboyt.com</a>. i don't know why i bothered with that <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag; does anyone actually click <code>mailto</code> links in 2016?
