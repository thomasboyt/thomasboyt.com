      <p>
        hi! i'm thomas and this is my <del>boring</del> professional website. i'm a software engineer in new york city and <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">recurse center</a> alumnus.
      </p>

      <p>
        i'm currently looking for a new full-time job. if you're on the hunt for a javascript developer, you should take a peek at my <a href="/resume.html">resume</a>! i'm based in nyc, but open to relocation or remote gigs.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>i make video games and put them on the internet at <a class="me-link" href="http://disco.zone/">disco.zone</a></strong>, a tld that i am very proud to have purchased before anyone else did. currently i'm working on <a class="me-link" href="https://manygolf.club/">manygolf</a>, a massively-multiplayer golf game you can play in your browser.
      </p>

      <p>
        various other projects in various states of success and failure can be found on <a class="me-link" href="https://github.com/thomasboyt">my github profile</a>. i've also got a very-infrequently-updated devlog <a href="http://devlog.disco.zone/">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        if you'd like to email me, you can do so at <a class="me-link" href="mailto:me@thomasboyt.com">me@thomasboyt.com</a>. but if you actually want to get in contact with me quickly, twitter is probably the better option. as is, like, smoke signal, or carrier pigeon.
